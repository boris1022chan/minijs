# TSP - Generic Algorithm
Travelling salesman problem is an NP-hard question that tries to find the shortest possible path where each point is visited exactly once. This project uses generic algorithm to improve the runtime compare to my previous project which uses lexicographic order.

## Usage
Click anywhere in the HTML canvas to add a point. After you are satisfied, click "find best path" button to let the algorithm run.
